        <h1>CHAT RESTRICTION</h1>

        <hr>

        <h3>Your account received the following penalties:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>3 day chat restriction ending on 8/31/23, 4:55 PM</li>
            <li>Honor level dropped</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Your account has been chat restricted because of player-reported chat logs. Your Honor level dropped and you lost access to free rewards. The way out of the penalty box is to consistently play to win without going aggro in chat. After serving your penalty and showing focus on staying cool, you'll get a notification unlocking your rewards again.</p>
        <p>Other players have judged your comms to be far below the standards of the League of Legends community. The vast majority of players agree that while League's an intense, competitive game, everyone deserves respect on the Rift. If you continue communicating this way you will receive increasingly long chat restrictions and may eventually he permanently banned.</p>
